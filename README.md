Preparation and Analysis, 24/09/2021
By Caleb Muinde

I have been recruited as a football analyst at Mchezopesa Ltd and tasked to accomplish the task below:

Provide a prediction result of a game between team 1 and team 2, based on who's home and who's away, and on whether or not the game is friendly (include rank in your training) using two approaches which are:

    i) Approach 1: Polynomial approach

        What to train given:
        1. Rank of home team
        2. Rank of away team
        3. Tournament type
Model 1: Predict how many goals the home team scores.

Model 2: Predict how many goals the away team scores.

    ii) Approach 2: Logistic approach

      Feature Engineering: Figure out from the home team’s perspective if the game is a Win, Lose or Draw (W, L, D)
